# VizLab — Performance Signal Explorer

A research visualization tool for hardware performance counter time-series data. VizLab combines a FastAPI backend with a Streamlit frontend to enable interactive exploration, comparison, and ratio analysis of system performance signals.

## What's New in v2

- **Derived Ratios Page** — Compute and plot derived metrics as ratios of two signals
  - Per-ratio plotting: Select device/workload/run/metrics independently for each ratio
  - "Plot this ratio" button for individual computations
  - "Plot ALL ratios" button for batch processing
  - Ratio caching to avoid recomputation
  - Scatter plot comparison of any two plotted ratios
- **Metric Ordering** — Metrics now display in device_config order (default batch → batch1 → batch2) instead of alphabetically
- **Multi-Page UI** — Streamlit sidebar navigation with dedicated pages for each analysis mode

## Architecture

- **Unified In-Memory Mode (Default)**: Streamlit imports the backend data processing module directly and processes all data in-memory within a single process. This completely bypasses network calls, port conflicts, and HTTP latency.
- **REST API Mode (Optional)**: If needed, the FastAPI backend can run standalone to expose REST endpoints (useful for third-party client integrations).

```

Performance counter datasets are loaded from the configured data directory (typically `Master_Data_Sets/` containing device subdirectories with CSV files and device configs).

## Data Repository (Private Submodule)

`Master_Data_Sets/` is a private Git submodule. Public clones of this repo will not be able to fetch the data unless they have access to the private repository.

If you have access, initialize the submodule after cloning:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If you do not have access, the app will run but the dataset directory will be empty.

## Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### Quick Start (Using Makefile)

From the project root, run the unified application:

```bash
make start
```

This single command launches the Streamlit frontend, which automatically loads and processes the datasets in-memory. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

See all available commands with `make help`

### Manual Start

#### Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

API documentation: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

#### Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
source .venv/bin/activate
streamlit run app.py
```

The frontend will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Features

### Single Signal Mode

- Select device, workload, run, and metric from sidebar
- Load and visualize a single signal
- Automatic detection and shading of attack regions (red overlay)
- Interactive Plotly chart with zoom and range slider controls

### Comparison Mode

Toggle "Comparison mode" at the top of the page to:

- Select two signals independently (Signal A and Signal B)
- Compare them on the same plot with dual y-axes
- Red shading indicates attacks in Signal A
- Orange shading indicates attacks in Signal B
- Automatic truncation to minimum signal length for alignment

### Derived Ratios Mode (v2)

Build and visualize derived metrics as ratios of two signals:

- **Build Ratios** — Add multiple ratio search entries with independent device/workload/run/metric selection
  - "Plot this ratio" button — Compute and plot individual ratios
  - "Duplicate search" button — Clone current entry settings
  - "Delete search" button — Remove an entry
- **Plotted Ratios** — View all computed ratios with attack region shading
- **Ratio Caching** — Prevents recomputation of identical ratios across plots
- **Pair Comparison** — Create scatter plots comparing any two plotted ratios
  - Filter by idle/attack labels
  - Dual-color visualization (blue = idle, red = attack)

Features:
- Per-ratio data source selection
- Automatic ratio caching to avoid recomputation
- Attack label merging (OR logic: attack if either numerator or denominator is attack)
- Divide-by-zero safety with NaN handling
- "Plot ALL ratios" for batch plotting

### Reload Registry

Click the 🔄 button in the sidebar to reload the backend device registry without restarting the server.

## API Endpoints (FastAPI Mode)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/devices` | GET | List all base device directories |
| `/variants` | GET | List available variants for a device (e.g. `v1`, `v2`, `PP`, `benign`) |
| `/workloads` | GET | List workloads for a device + variant |
| `/runs` | GET | List runs for a device + variant + workload (automatically merges benign runs for comparison) |
| `/metrics` | GET | List metrics for a device + variant (ordered by configs) |
| `/signal` | GET | Fetch a single signal (attack or benign with dynamic routing) |
| `/reload` | POST | Reload dataset registry |

## Data Format

Each signal response includes:

```json
{
  "signal_id": "device::workload::run::metric",
  "source": {
    "device": "...",
    "workload": "...",
    "run": "..."
  },
  "metric": {
    "name": "...",
    "unit": "events"
  },
  "time": {
    "type": "index",
    "values": [...]
  },
  "values": [...],
  "labels": {
    "type": "attack",
    "values": [0, 1, 0, ...],
    "batch": "..."
  },
  "transform": {
    "window_size": 1,
    "aggregation": "none"
  }
}
```

**Labels**: `1` indicates attack region, `0` indicates benign. Labels are computed by the backend from device config.

## Derived Ratios Implementation Details

### Per-Ratio Plotting

Each ratio search entry is independently tracked:
- Device, workload, run, numerator metric, denominator metric
- Clicking "Plot this ratio" computes only that ratio
- Results stored in `st.session_state.ratios` dict (keyed by entry_id)
- Each entry can be re-plotted without affecting others

### Batch Plotting

"Plot ALL ratios" iterates through all entries and:
- Skips entries with missing selections
- Reuses cached ratios when possible
- Replaces entire ratios dict (overwrites previous plots)
- Triggers full re-render

### Ratio Computation

1. Fetch numerator signal from backend
2. Fetch denominator signal from backend
3. Divide arrays element-wise with divide-by-zero handling
4. Merge attack labels (OR logic: 1 if either signal has attack)
5. Cache result by (device, workload, run, numerator_metric, denominator_metric) key

### Scatter Comparison

- Select any two plotted ratios as X and Y axes
- Filters out non-finite values
- Renders idle (blue) and attack (red) points separately
- Hover info shows exact coordinates

## Development

### Backend Changes

Edit `backend/app.py` and the server will auto-reload.

### Frontend Changes

Edit pages in `frontend/pages/` and Streamlit will auto-detect changes.

### Adding New Pages

Create new files in `frontend/pages/` following Streamlit's naming convention:
- Files are automatically discovered
- Use sidebar for navigation (built-in)
- Import shared functions from main app

### Device Configs

Add or modify `Master_Data_Sets/<device_name>/device_config.json` to define metrics and batches. Use the reload button to pick up changes without restarting.

Device config structure:
```json
{
  "batches": {
    "default": {
      "probe_prefix": "...",
      "probes": [...],
      "metrics": [...]
    },
    "batch1": {...},
    "batch2": {...}
  }
}
```

Metrics appear in order: default batch → batch1 → batch2 (no alphabetical sorting).

## Notes

- All attack labels come from the backend — no inference in the frontend
- CSV files are read by the backend only
- Frontend consumes data exclusively through REST APIs
- Comparison mode truncates signals to minimum length for x-axis alignment
- Ratio computation is lazy — plots only created on button click
- Ratio cache is session-scoped and cleared on page reload

## Session State Management

The frontend uses Streamlit's session state to track:
- `ratios` — Dict of computed ratios keyed by entry_id
- `ratio_cache` — Dict of cached signal pairs to avoid re-fetching
- `ratio_search_entries` — List of ratio search entry configurations
- `ratio_entry_counter` — Counter for unique entry IDs

This ensures plots persist across widget interactions and sidebar changes.
